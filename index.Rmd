## Motivation Behind the EDS Tool

The EDS Tool investigates the *exponential distribution* with comparison to Central Limit Theorem (CLT). 

With the Central Limit Theorem, the rule states that the distribution of average of IID (Independant & Identically Distributed) variables, (when properly normalized), becomes that of a standard normal distribution.  This is more evident as the sample size increases.

Also for a sampling distribution to be normal it should statify attributes of a standard normal:

* Where 68% distribution lies within 1 standard deviation from it's distribution mean.
* Secondly, 97% lies within 2 standard deviations awat from from distribution mean.
* Lastly, 99% lies within 3 standard deviations from the distribution mean.

The EDS Tool provides a quick way to run a variety of simulations on exponential distributions in real-time.  The source material for this tool was based on lectures, notes and homework from Project #1 within Statistic Inference course offered on Coursera.org for the John Hopkin's Data Science Specialization.

## Formulas

Within the tool, here are a few of the formulas/functions used within the tool.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION
getExpDist <- function(n, lambda) rexp(n,lambda)

# CALCULATION OF THE THEORECTICAL MEAN
getExpDistMean <- function(lambda) 1/lambda

# CALCULATION OF THE THEORECTICAL VARIANCE
getExpDistStdDev <- function(lambda) 1/lambda

# SIMULATION TO OBTAIN SAMPLES (AVERAGES OF AVERAGES)
getSimulationExpDistMeansDataFrame <- function(n, lambda, nosim) {
  output = NULL
  for (i in 1 : nosim) output = c(output, mean(getExpDist(n=n,lambda=lambda)))
  data.frame(x_axis = output)
}
```

### Demo of the normal distribution plot provided in the EDS Tool

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
lambda <- 0.2
n <- 40
nosim <- 1000
simulationExpDistDF <- getSimulationExpDistMeansDataFrame(n,lambda,nosim)
simulationExpDistMean <- mean(simulationExpDistDF$x_axis)
expDistMean <- getExpDistMean(lambda = lambda)
scaleStepBreaks <- function(mean_mu,distance) ((mean_mu-distance):(mean_mu+distance))
exampleExpDistPlot1000 <- ggplot(
  data = simulationExpDistDF) +    # SET DATE
  aes(x = x_axis) +                     # SET X
  geom_histogram(                       # PLOT HISTOGRAM
    binwidth=0.05, alpha=0.2, aes(y=..density..), colour="black", fill="light blue") + 
  labs(                              # ADD LABELS
       title="Sampling Distribution of 1000 simulations of the Exponential Distibution",
       x="Averages", y="Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(                   # FIX X_AXIS SCALE
    breaks=scaleStepBreaks(expDistMean,4)) +
  geom_density(                         # SAMPLE MEANS DENSITY CURVE (RED)
    colour="red", size= 1) +
